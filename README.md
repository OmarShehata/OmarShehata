I do science communication, for scientists. 

- _Question: When a scientist discovers something new, how do they know that someone else hasn't already discovered it?_
- _Answer: they don't. They only know that it is novel to their field (aka their information network, whose boundary is their language)_

This was true in 1948, and is still true today.

This problem is itself a research question. "Metascience" is what [Analogue](https://analoguegroup.org/) calls it. I think of it as a subset of "open memetics" - the study & engineering of information networks. 

"Open Memetics" is like sociology, except with large scale field experiments. It's "open" to contrast it against the field of "closed/dark" memetics (when social media companies run A/B tests on millions of humans but do not publish the results). Another difference is that "open memetics" attempts to unify psychology & sociology, as micro-memetics and macro-memetics, to find the universal laws that hold at all scales.  

Marketing, propaganda, and art, can all be considered "applied memetics".

 There is a similarity here to geo-engineering in that any work done interferes with each other, because it's all operating on the same shared system.
